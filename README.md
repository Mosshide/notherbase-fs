# notherbase-fs
A package to help one develop a base. 

A base is an Express.js server that will render EJS web pages with automatic route creation. It also has a spirit world, a MongoDB-connected API to provide those pages with dynamic data and multiplayer interaction. A little bit of socket.io is sprinkled for good measure.
